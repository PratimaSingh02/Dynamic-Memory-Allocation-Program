# Dynamic-Memory-Allocation-Program
NOTE: The code contains first and worst fit algorithms in C.

Dynamic memory allocation is when an executing program/process requests that the operating system give it a block of main memory.
Algorithms for dynamic memory allocation:
1). First fit algorithm
2). Best fit alorithm
3). Worst fit algortithm
